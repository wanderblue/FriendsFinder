Friend Finder Application

Description
Friends Finder  is compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
You will use Express to handle routing. 

The  FriendsFinder survey has 10 questions. Each answer will be on a scale of 1 to 5 based on how much the user agrees or disagrees with a question. When the survey is submitted, an existing user record closest to the current user's responses is found and returned. The closest set of user responses is defined as the set with the lowest absolute difference for all ten questions combined.

Demo
Friend Finder is deployed to Heroku.
